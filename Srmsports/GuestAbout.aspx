<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karachi Maharashtriya Shikshan Prasarak Mandal (K.M.S.P.) was established in 1929 by the great academician Late Vitthal Ganesh Pradhanalias Bhaisaheb Pradhanand Late D. V. AnaokarGuruji, for the Maharashtriyans in Karachi. The K.M.S.P. Mandal started its first Marathi Medium High School “ShriShivaji High- School”, at Karachi (Pakistan).After partition, the founder members of the K.M.S.P. Mandal had to come back to their home villages.</p> 
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the due course, taking into account the lack of educational facilities in the hilly and rural area of Konkan, they decided to continue their efforts to give fillip to education in Sindhudurg and particularly at Kudal and have started witha Highs chool named “Kudal High School, Kudal”.</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years the then Management have added and upgraded various facilities/courses at Kudal (Sindhudurg) and Kurla (Mumbai) to meet the challenges of modern era and to help students and the society in the changing scenario.</p>
