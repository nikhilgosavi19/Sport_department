The College has spacious classrooms, well furnished and well equipped laboratories, library and academically excellent teachers. From the beginning, attaining excellence and efficiency has been a primary goal of the institution and management. The college offers UG programmes in Arts, Commerce and Science. Along with that, we have career oriented programmes such as Computer Systems & Application & Direct and Indirect Taxation at Third Year B.Com. We have also added new professional courses like B.Sc. - Computer Science from 2002, Bachelor of Management Studies [BMS] and Bachelor of Information Technology [B. Sc.- IT] from the academic year 2009-2010.

The college has 15 academic departments. Curriculum design is prerogative of the Board of Studies of the Mumbai University. However, the faculty members enjoy the freedom of making constructive suggestions to the Board of Studies in updating the contents of respective syllabi. Teachers and students are encouraged to use computers/internet to enhance their learning and understanding. For this purpose, college has set up a “UGC Network Resource Centre” where computer/internet facility is made available free-of-cost. From this year, the college is progressing towards the semester based system of teaching and examination as per the university norms. Student strength of the college is about 1130 and most of them belong to economically weaker sections of society. Such students are helped through UGC / Govt. / Semi Govt. / NGO's Scholarship schemes while remaining students not covered by these schemes are helped from the Student's Aid Fund of the college. Admissions are done as per the rules prescribed by the University of Mumbai. Academic merit is duly recognized while filling up vacancies. Preference is also given to the students who are good in sports and extra-curricular activities. Efforts are made to achieve excellence in Teaching-Learning and Evaluation.
