            <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      We, at the K. M. S. P. Mandal, Kudal and Sant Rawool Maharaj Mahavidyalaya are very much delighted to welcome the new generation of students seeking admission in various faculties. Looking in the past, the institution is proud about the goals which are already achieved and also equally proud of the students who played a very vital role in achieving these goals. The college is now well renowned by its various outstanding activities at every level; right from district to the university as well as the state. We have academic excellence coupled with bright achievements in NSS, NCC, DLLE, Cultural, Sports and Social Activities in last few years. Our students from all faculties have attained an excellent academic record and are presently involved in their respective advanced studies or and are performing well at their professional levels. Our competent and enthusiastic teachers have taken initiatives in various Research activities in their respective subjects. Many of the teachers are involved in the major and minor research projects. Besides, students are also consistently encouraged and inspired to participate in research as well as other curricular and co-curricular activities by the Principal and staff.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The college has 15 academic departments. Curriculum design is prerogative of the Board of Studies of the Mumbai University. However, the faculty members enjoy the freedom of making constructive suggestions to the Board of Studies in updating the contents of respective syllabi. Teachers and students are encouraged to use computers/internet to enhance their learning and understanding. For this purpose, college has set up a “UGCNetwork Resource Centre” where computer/internet facility is made available free-of-cost. 
            <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this year, the college is progressing towards the semester based system of teaching and examination as per the university norms. Student strength of the college is about 1130 and most of them belong to economically weaker sections of society. Such students are helped through UGC / Govt. / Semi Govt. / NGO's Scholarship schemes while remaining students not covered by these schemes are helped from the Student's Aid Fund of the college. Admissions are done as per the rules prescribed by the University of Mumbai. Academic merit is duly recognized while filling up vacancies. Preference is also given to the students who are good in sports and extra-curricular activities. Efforts are made to achieve excellence in Teaching-Learning and Evaluation.
